// Vores "fighter" laver 2x bomber når han respawner...? <------ WORKS!!
// Vores Slow, fra supnimph, virker ikke, hvis target allerede er slowet... <------- FIXED!!
// Ville gerne gøre sådan at hvis forskellen mellem @directionget og @angle var mindre end 10 så skulle vores "fighter" prioritere afstand frem for @angle!!! <--- DEFEATED!!!

So the game is gonna have somewhat of a storyline... i dont realy know, but ill try to implement one as best as i can! Keep in mind, this is final, 
so im most likely gonna publish the game, if i can get the ideas working and everything. I just need to do more planning and then i can get to work!
ATM i seem to have the experience necessary for working with this game and im sure ill get something outta it!! 


--- 02-08 ---

-- Patched the fighter "death" so its now completely invisible!! (and it doesn't respawn *A*)

-- 30/08 ---

-- RESET PLAYER methods <------- FIXED!!!
-- reset FIGHTER METHODS <------- FIXED!!!

-- Rework the timer functions in @fighter <------- FIXED!!!

-- More Optimising...

-- Okay now at this point, I've decided to make it so that you can choose 3 things before starting a fight:
-----> Primary Weapon
-----> Secondary Weapon
-----> Ability
These 3 things will be your loadout for the battle, so you can choose whatever fits your style or whatever 
is optimal for that boss specifically...
The problem is that we need a place to choose from, and thats what im considering at the moment.
I'd like you to choose your loadout in a menu of its own, so we would definitaly need more menus!
<--- DONE!!!

--- Kay so from now on I need to things done:

- First of all I need to create the elektricity weapon that shoots out randomly, but the "animation" takes a long time to optimize.

- Second I need to polish the targeting system for "supnimph" in order to enable targeting against even instances, and to make it look better!

--- Kay so I've finished the animation for our elektricity weapon!
